  <Description>
     <p>webman/imageSelector.cgi in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) 4.0 before 4.0-2259, 4.2 before 4.2-3243, and 4.3 before 4.3-3810 Update 1 allows remote attackers to append data to arbitrary files, and consequently execute arbitrary code, via a pathname in the SLICEUPLOAD X-TMP-FILE HTTP header.
         
         Synology DiskStation Manager versions 4.3-3776-3 and below allow a remote unauthenticated user to append arbitrary data to files on the system under root privileges. According to Synology:
         Synology File Station in DSM employs a technique called "Slice Upload" to upload files when the file size is over 4GB [in the] Firefox browser. Since this feature is implemented in DSM4.0, all versions of DSM after DSM4.0 are subject to this vulnerability.
         
         To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to/webman/imageSelector.cgi containing the header fields X-TYPE-NAME: SLICEUPLOAD and X-TMP-FILEwith the valid path of the file to append malicious code or data.
