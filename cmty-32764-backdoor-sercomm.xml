  <Description>
     <p>Multiple routers contain a flaw, as the undocumented scfgmgr service acts as a backdoor when processing incoming requests. With specially crafted requests, a remote attacker can perform various actions e.g. dump the configuration (disclosing usernames and passwords in cleartext) or execute arbitrary shell commands.

    <Solution id="cmty-32764-backdoor-sercomm" time="30m">
      <summary>Currently, there are no known upgrades or patches to correct this vulnerability. Cisco has indicated that fixes for the WAP4410N Wireless-N Access Point, WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router, and RVS4000 4-port Gigabit Security Router will be available at the end of January, 2014.

Note that NETGEAR claimed to have fixed this in 1.1.00.49 but the backdoor is still present, but now requires a 'magic port knock' to activate the backdoor. Due to the vendor obscuring it further and keeping the backdoor, this has been abstracted and covered under a new entry. </summary>
      <workaround>
        <p>Configure a firewall rule that blocks access to the backdoor.</p>
