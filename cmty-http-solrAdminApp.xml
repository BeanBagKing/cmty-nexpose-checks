  <Description>
    <p>Apache Solr is the popular, open source search platform from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling, and geo-spatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing distributed search and index replication. The exposed interface is also commonly used by worms and bots to install cryptominers and consume the systems resources for financial gain.
